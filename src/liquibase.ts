   * - You have a changelog with a specific changeset and want to create a table in your database, and then apply your changes manually without using Liquibase. In this case, there will be no record of this change in the DATABASECHANGELOG table.
   * - Then you decide to deploy the same changeset by using the `update` command, Liquibase checks the DATABASECHANGELOG table to see if there is such a changeset. Since there is no record of it, Liquibase tries to create a table, but as it already exists, you receive an error.
   * - As a result, Liquibase stops deployment at that specific changeset without executing it.
   * - Running the `markNextChangeSetRan` adds that changeset in the changelog as a record even though the table is already created. The command detects that the changeset was deployed.
   * Additionally, the best practice is to run the `markNextChangeSetRanSQL` helper command to inspect the `markNextChangeSetRan` SQL, so you can correct any issues that may arise before running the command.
